Floor_Sentiment_Beat.py looks for phrasing related to international organizations, extracts the surrounding text, and gives a basic -1:1 sentiment score. Mostly for exploratory analysis before moving forward with the project.

Kwicsearch_Final.R is a previous iteration of the floor speech sentiment project, using R. It's not pretty.

The scrapers .pys pull PDFs from the UN Bibliographic website and then count and store votes therefrom.

UN_Vote_Columnar_Parser.rmd grabs scanned PDFs of transcripts from a UN subsidiary sites and combs through all their idiosyncracies to find votes. It's very messy.
